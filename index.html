Hi There!
</p>
<p>
I am the host of this webpage, and my full name is above. I go by David instead of Davide to keep it simple. "davide" is pronouced (Da.veed), it is a name of French origin; is very common in Europe. I myself am of Italian ethnicity. The name was passed on to me in order to honour my grandfather, who was also Davide Marchese. As was his grandfather. Likewise, my father Stefano, was named after his grandfather, and so on.
