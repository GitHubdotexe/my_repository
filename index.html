<p class="w3-left"> Hi there! If you're reading this, you obviously have some connection to who I am. 
However we met I want to express my happiness that we crossed paths. But you came here for more info. 
SO, allow me to tell you about myself. I am a medical student who is passionate about hockey, soccer, technology, math, and science. 
Some of my hobbies include video games, particularly Super Smash Bros. As well, I enjoy passing time with my partner and our dog, Malibu.
<br />
<br />
Malibu is named after one of my father's past vehicles. This is a cogntive method designed to associate new material with my father's long-term memory.  
(He is brain-injured.)
<br />
<br />
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrqg1oqfg_Y" title="My Home Town - Westfort Films" target="_blank">I am proud to say I'm from Thunder Bay.</a> 
(Born and raised.) 
<br />
Follow the link for a wonderful song made by locals about Thunder Bay. 
<br />
<br />
I also want to shoutout some very cool friends from medical school. Especially Seb Labelle. He's a toilet seat fan but he's really not that bad... good even. Haha JK he's great. Very caring and funny. Wait till you hear the guy say "Pacinian"...But he is right! Its 'Pa~chini'. I know as well he will be able to find my easter egg no problem becuase he has great attention to detail
but also because he knows his stuff when it comes to this easter egg. Also he is the best male chef I've ever met. <br />
MORE TEXT TO COME. HAVE SUGGESTIONS? PLS TEXT ME.</p>

1. make a database with MySQL
2. connect MYSQL database to website with PHP
3. do checks on entry and find way to save data
