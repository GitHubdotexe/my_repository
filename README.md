This is my personal website hosted through GitHub.
GitHub is great. I love it.
I am a medical student passionate about hockey, soccer, technology, math and science. 
Some of my hobbies include video games, particularly Super Smash Bros. As well I enjoy much time with my partner and our dog, Malibu.
